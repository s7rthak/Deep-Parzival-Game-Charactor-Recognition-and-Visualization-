# Deep Parzival: Game Charactor Recognition and Visualization

- [x] Data scraping from the web.
- [x] Model training through pretrained network and our (augmented!) dataset.
- [x] Model visualization through GradCam.
- [ ] Different types of GradCAM experimentation.
- [x] GradCAM on multiple models.
- [x] GradCAM on multiple layers in a single model.
- [x] Effect of data order analogous to human eye-sight model.
- [ ] Final report

Note: Add in the data in the directory "dataset" (for example:- dataset/ezio, etc.) before running model.py
